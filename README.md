# HUE Project
**Welcome to this prodject page!ðŸ‘‹**

### A littlebit about the project

A little while ago we installed Philips [HUE lights](https://www.philips-hue.com/) in my house, philips hue has a great app to control the light.
I was inspired by the app, so I tried to create a web app that would allow you to control the hue lights in your home.
